The benefit of character-based language models is their small vocabulary and flexibility in handling any words, punctuation, and other document structure.

I try to regulate the overfit issue by adding Dropout layer and two additional Dense layers, it has lower the accuracy for a little bit. When I tested with the model3 methods piped with validation set, the method does work and the model becomes less overfit (validation accuracy has incrased from 8% in model1 to 18% in model3). However, it is still overfit. I suspect the fundamental reason of overfit is due to the very small text corpus. I need a larger text corpus to train the model.**"
